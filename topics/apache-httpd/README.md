# Apache HTTP Server (httpd)

## 1. What is Apache HTTP Server?

### Overview

The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as **Apache httpd**, is a free and open-source web server software developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It is one of the most widely used web servers in the world and plays a key role in the growth of the internet by supporting websites of all sizes and types.

Apache httpd supports a wide range of features including dynamic loading of modules, powerful URL rewriting, authentication mechanisms, and support for various programming languages through integration (e.g., PHP, Python, Perl). It can serve both static and dynamic content and is highly configurable and extensible.
